          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-lg">
            Garbh Sanskar, derived from ancient Ayurvedic principles, is a holistic approach to pregnancy and childbirth that emphasizes the importance of mental, physical, and emotional well-being for both the mother and the developing fetus. This practice focuses on creating a nurturing environment that fosters the healthy growth of the baby and enhances the mother's overall health during pregnancy.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-lg">
            The term "Garbh" refers to the fetus, while "Sanskar" translates to the process of nurturing or shaping. Together, they signify the profound impact of maternal care on the unborn child's development.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#394E29] mb-4">Understanding Garbh Sanskar</h2>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg">
            In Ayurveda, the period of pregnancy is considered a sacred time, and Garbh Sanskar encompasses a range of practices aimed at promoting the physical and emotional health of both mother and child. It is believed that the experiences and emotions of the mother during pregnancy can significantly influence the baby's personality, health, and future well-being.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-lg">
            Therefore, Garbh Sanskar emphasizes a holistic approach, focusing on the following aspects:
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#394E29] mb-4">1. Nutrition</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg">
            Proper nutrition is crucial during pregnancy. Ayurvedic principles recommend a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients to support the mother's health and the baby's development. Foods that are nourishing, warm, and easy to digest are encouraged. Important nutrients include:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-8 space-y-3 text-gray-700 text-lg">
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Fruits and Vegetables:</span> Fresh, seasonal produce provides vitamins and minerals essential for fetal growth.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Whole Grains:</span> Foods like rice, quinoa, and oats are excellent sources of energy and nourishment.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Healthy Fats:</span> Ghee and nuts are recommended for their beneficial effects on brain development.</li>

          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#394E29] mb-4">2. Mental Well-being</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-lg">
            Emotional health is equally important in Garbh Sanskar. Stress and anxiety can negatively affect both the mother and the unborn child. Ayurvedic practices recommend:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-8 space-y-3 text-gray-700 text-lg">
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Meditation and Mindfulness:</span> Regular meditation helps reduce stress, enhances emotional well-being, and fosters a positive mindset.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Positive Affirmations:</span> Reciting affirmations and mantras can create a harmonious atmosphere and strengthen the bond between mother and child.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Soothing Music:</span> Listening to calming music can help relax the mother and promote a peaceful environment for the baby.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#394E29] mb-4">3. Physical Activity</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-lg">
            Gentle exercise is encouraged to maintain physical health and improve circulation. Yoga, in particular, is beneficial during pregnancy, as it enhances flexibility, strengthens muscles, and promotes relaxation. Specific yoga poses designed for pregnant women can help alleviate common discomforts associated with pregnancy, such as back pain and swelling.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#394E29] mb-4">4. Connection with Nature</h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-lg">
            Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of nature in nurturing both physical and mental health. Spending time outdoors, practicing grounding techniques, and connecting with the earth can help the mother feel more centered and balanced.
          </p>
