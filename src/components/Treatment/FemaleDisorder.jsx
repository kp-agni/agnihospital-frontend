            Female disorders refer to a range of health conditions that
            specifically affect the female reproductive system and overall
            well-being. These include menstrual irregularities, hormonal
            imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis,
            infertility, menopause-related issues, and other concerns related to
