            Lifestyle diseases, also known as non-communicable diseases (NCDs),
            are a growing health concern in India, contributing to over 61% of
            deaths. These include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity,
            and hypertension, primarily caused by unhealthy diets, sedentary
            lifestyles, stress, and inadequate sleep. With rapid urbanization
            and changing habits, the prevalence of these conditions is rising,
            affecting individuals as young as 35. Preventive measures like a
            balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and routine
            health check-ups are essential in combating these diseases. Raising
            awareness and promoting healthier lifestyles can significantly
            reduce the impact of lifestyle diseases in the long run.
