            Skin and hair disorders encompass a wide range of conditions
            affecting the health, appearance, and function of the skin, scalp,
            and hair. These disorders can arise due to genetic factors,
            environmental influences, hormonal imbalances, nutritional
            deficiencies, or underlying medical conditions. Common skin issues
            like acne, eczema, psoriasis, and infections can cause discomfort,
            irritation, and long-term skin damage if not properly managed.
            Similarly, hair problems such as hair loss, dandruff, and premature
            graying can impact self-confidence and overall well-being. While
            some conditions are temporary and easily treatable, others may
            require long-term care and professional treatment. Understanding the
            causes, symptoms, and management options for skin and hair disorders
            is crucial for maintaining healthy skin and hair, preventing
            complications, and improving overall quality of life.
