            Male disorders refer to a range of health conditions that
            specifically affect men, often related to hormonal imbalances,
            reproductive health, and age-related changes. These include issues
            like low testosterone (hypogonadism), erectile dysfunction, prostate
            diseases (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer),
            and male infertility. Other concerns, like male-pattern baldness,
            osteoporosis, and mental health conditions such as depression and
            anxiety, also fall under male disorders. Lifestyle, genetics, and
            environmental factors play a significant role in these conditions,
            making proper nutrition, exercise, and medical consultation
            essential for prevention and management.
