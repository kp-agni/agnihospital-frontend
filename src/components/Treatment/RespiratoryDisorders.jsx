            Respiratory disorders refer to a group of medical conditions that
            affect the lungs and the breathing process. These disorders can
            range from mild conditions like asthma to more severe diseases such
            as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or lung
            cancer. Respiratory disorders can cause difficulty in breathing,
            coughing, chest pain, and fatigue. They may be triggered by a
            variety of factors, including infections, allergens, environmental
            pollutants, smoking, or genetic predisposition. Effective treatment
            often depends on the specific condition and its severity, with
            management focusing on improving airflow, reducing inflammation, and
            preventing complications.
