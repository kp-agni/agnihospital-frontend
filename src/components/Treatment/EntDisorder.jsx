            ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) disorders refer to a wide range of
            medical conditions affecting the ear, nose, throat, and related
            structures of the head and neck. These disorders can impact
            essential functions such as hearing, breathing, speaking, and
            swallowing. Common ENT conditions include ear infections, sinusitis,
            allergies, tonsillitis, nasal congestion, voice disorders, and more
            severe issues like hearing loss, vertigo, or throat cancers.
            Treatment for these conditions varies from medications and lifestyle
            adjustments to surgical interventions, depending on the severity and
            underlying cause. Regular check-ups with an ENT specialist can help
            in early diagnosis and effective management.
