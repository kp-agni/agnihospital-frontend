            Pediatric disorders refer to a wide range of medical conditions that
            affect infants, children, and adolescents, impacting their physical,
            emotional, and cognitive development. These disorders can be
            congenital, meaning present at birth, or acquired due to infections,
            environmental factors, nutritional deficiencies, or genetic
            predisposition. Common pediatric disorders include respiratory
            infections, congenital heart defects, asthma, autism spectrum
            disorders, growth and developmental delays, and nutritional
            deficiencies like anemia. Early diagnosis and specialized pediatric
            care are crucial in managing these conditions, ensuring proper
            growth and development while improving the child‚Äôs overall quality
            of life.
